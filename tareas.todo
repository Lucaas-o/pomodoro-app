Great choice! A Pomodoro app is an excellent project for practicing front-end development, timers, and UI/UX design. Hereâ€™s a roadmap to get you started:
Features to Include

    Basic Timer:
        Work sessions (e.g., 25 minutes).
        Breaks (e.g., 5 minutes for short breaks, 15 minutes for long breaks).

    Customization:
        Allow users to set custom durations for work and break sessions.

    Task Management:
        Add a list of tasks to work on during the Pomodoro sessions.
        Mark tasks as complete.

    Progress Tracking:
        Show the number of Pomodoros completed today.
        Optionally, log progress for future analysis.

    Notification System:
        Alerts or sounds when a session ends.
        Browser or mobile push notifications.

    Dark/Light Mode:
        Allow users to switch themes for better usability.

Tools & Technologies

    Front-End:
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
        Frameworks like React or Vue.js for a more dynamic app.

    Optional Back-End (for saving user data):
        Node.js with a database like MongoDB or Firebase.

    Styling:
        Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or custom CSS for a sleek design.

Steps to Build

    Plan the UI:
        Sketch out the layout: Timer, task list, settings, etc.

    Implement the Timer:
        Use setInterval() in JavaScript to create a countdown.

    Add Interactivity:
        Start, pause, reset buttons.
        Update the UI dynamically as the timer progresses.

    Enhance User Experience:
        Add animations or progress bars.
        Implement sound alerts or visual cues.

    Polish and Deploy:
        Optimize your app for different screen sizes (mobile-friendly).
        Deploy it on GitHub Pages or a hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.
